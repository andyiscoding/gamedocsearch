Should do the following

1) Read in the instructions and tokenize by send to ES by sentence. Should include 

	(page number, assoiciated image, sentence)

If it wasen't so damned expensive and I wasen't working on a vm,  maybe putting a small python ingest script and integrating it into a nifi processor.
The python script would accept in page delimiter and just spit out sentences to ES. Could listen for new files being dropped in.
